# Backend

The Magento_Backend module contains common infrastructure and assets for other modules to be defined and used in their
administration user interface (UI). It should not contain anything specific to other modules. Among many things it
handles the logic of authentication and authorization of users, locale, layout, search, session, translation and
several other configurations for admin user.

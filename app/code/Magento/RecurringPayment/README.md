Module Magento\RecurringPayment provides a new ability to set and configure recurring payments on a product. These are most often used for subscriptions or products with installment payment plans.
When a product like this is purchased from the store, the customer is redirected to a 3rd-party payment system where a "recurring payment agreement" with the store is signed/authorized by the customer.
A recurring payment agreement is an agreement between the customer and the store authorized at the side of a payment system. In the payment system, this agreement authorizes the merchant to charge the customer account again in the future according to the recurring payment settings.
These are called "recurring payments" in Magento. In the 3rd-party payment system, a recurring payment is an accounting record that captures payments on a regular basis and according to the payment schedule defined in the recurring payment.

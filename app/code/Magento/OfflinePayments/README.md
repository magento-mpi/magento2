Module Magento\OfflinePayments implements a list of offline payment methods. "Offline" means that it is internal method without any interactions with payment gateways.

* Bank transfer
This method was designed for those customer users, who prefer to pay their orders by the bank transfers.

* Cash on delivery
This payment method can be applied for customers, who do not want to pay their orders in electronic form or by using the bank transfers.

* Check / Money Order
This method is enabled by default when Magento is just installed. It is intended for payments for order by checks and cash money (can be sent via the post-office or delivered by the courier).

* Purchase order
Customers can use this payment method to buy products and assign a corresponding purchase order number generated in their accounting system to the sales order generated in Magento.

Module Magento\CustomerFinance implements feature to import/export store credit and reward customer data. It is implemented as separate module near to Magento\ScheduledImportExport to improve modularity and clarify dependencies.
The module joins basic customer data with reward and customer balance information to be able to import/export customer data with the reward and store credit. It allows store administrators to both manually and automatically (via a scheduled import/export) import and export this data.

The module functionality allows customers to have a non-monetary balance in store credits associated to their accounts and use it for purchasing products. Store credit can be used by customers for paying in the web store and by the store administrator for refunding money to customers.
Additionally, gift card balances can be transferred to the customer's store credit, saving customers from having to manually enter the gift card code on subsequent purchases. Also, by transferring money from a gift card to the store credit balance, the customers are protected from their gift card to get expired, if the expiration parameter was set in the feature configuration.
The store administrator has the ability to view and edit (add, change or reset) a customer's store credit balance at any time. In the frontend, a customer can see the Store Credit tab on the My Account page where is displayed the current balance, as well as the balance history.

            <h1>Overview of Magento 2.0</h1>
            The Magento platform is a flexible open source ecommerce platform written in PHP.
            It enables merchants to set up and run online stores selling goods, electronic downloads, and services. The
            main differentiating characteristics of Magento include:
            The product is extremely configurable â€“ you can build a completely different look and feel to your site to
            help your brand stand out.
            The source code base is open source, so you have access to all code in case you need to inspect or fix
            anything.
            Magento Enterprise Edition and Community Edition are supplied as software packages and are not SaaS
            solutions, which means that you own all your data.
            Note that there are partners who can host the software for you if you wish.
            Due to the flexibility and extensibility of the product, a large developer ecosystem has grown around the
            product.
            Magento Community Edition (Magento CE) is freely available for download and usage free of charge.
            This gives site developers absolute control over how a web store is built.
            You can use Magento CE as is, make minor adjustments to customize a store, or make major alterations to
            develop a completely customized experience for a merchant.
            Magento Enterprise Edition (Magento EE) is licensed (for a fee) software, covered by a support contract.
            It is an extended version of Magento CE that includes optimized performance and additional features .

        This report summarizes tax information for Orders placed within the designated scope and period of time.
        The scope can be defined in the Show Report for drop-down at the top of the page. There will be one line for each
        Period.
        A Period can be a Day, Month, or Year, and is defined in the Show by drop-down at the top of the page.
        The number of periods in the report depends on the date range designated at the top of the page.
        Each Period will further be divided by the Tax Rates. For each Tax Rate, you can see the total number of Orders
        placed using that Tax Rate, and the total amount of tax charged using that Tax Rate.
        There will also be a row that totals the amounts of all Periods displayed in the report.

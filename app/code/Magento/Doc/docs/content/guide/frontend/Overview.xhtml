        This guide describes how to change the look and feel of your Magento web store. This is one of the key
        advantages of Magento – the ability to make your site “your own” and not a cookie cutter copy of other stores.
        There are four levels of customization you can apply to your site, where the levels require different
        development skills.
        You can make relatively simple changes to your site using CSS to change colors and the look-and-feel of various
        interface components, replacing images, and other relatively cosmetic changes. No structural changes are made to
        pages – you accept the structure of the site provided by default by modules you load on to your site. This can
        be a good starting point for a site as it is requires the least effort and knowledge.
        A small step beyond changing CSS and imagery on your site is to make changes to the HTML generated by existing
        modules. This requires rudimentary PHP skills to adjust PHTML template files. While PHP coding is involved, this
        is typically copying and pasting small fragments of PHP code from existing template files into a new template
        file with differently structured HTML. This can be useful if the existing HTML generated does not have
        sufficient CSS class names or HTML elements to achieve the presentation change you would like to achieve.
        The next level of sophistication is you can make structural changes to your site by moving functionality between
        places on a page or to completely different pages. This is achieved using the Magento layout engine. No PHP
        coding is required to make layout changes, but the layout engine is moderately sophisticated.
        Finally, you can develop new modules to add new custom functionality to your site or to extend functionality
        provided by existing Magento or third party modules. This third level of customization is not addressed in this
        guide. Please refer to the Developers' Guide for details on how to develop new modules. This requires PHP
        programming knowledge in addition to knowledge of all of the above areas.

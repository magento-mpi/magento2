This guide is for developers (typically <b>PHP</b>developers) responsible for customizing a site. 
This Â includes adding new modules to a site, creating your own custom extensions, and system integration.
These are the topics we're planning to include in the Magento 2 Developers' Guide. Completed topics are live links; all other topics are planned or in development.

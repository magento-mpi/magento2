# Website Restriction

**Website Restriction** provides administrators the ability to either restrict all access to the site or to restrict
access to only logged in customers. You may want to restrict all access to the site when the site is closed for
maintenance. You may want to restrict the site to only logged in customers if the site is a B2B site or if there is
a private sale for only registered customers.

    <div class=""privacy-policy-content"">
        <p>This website (""website"") is operated by Luma Inc., which includes Luma stores, and Luma Private Sales. This privacy policy only covers information collected at this website, and does not cover any information collected offline by Luma. All Luma websites are currently covered by this privacy policy. </p>

        <h2 id=""privacy-policy-title-1"">Luma Security</h2>
        <p>Personal information provided on the website and online credit card transactions are transmitted through a secure server. We are committed to handling your personal information with high standards of information security. We take appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative steps to maintain the security and accuracy of personally identifiable information we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as employing electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access.</p>

        <p>Our website uses encryption technology, like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL encrypts ordering information such as your name, address, and credit card number. Our Customer Care center and stores also operate over a private, secure network. Please note that email is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information.</p>

        <h2 id=""privacy-policy-title-2"">Luma Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>To help us achieve our goal of providing the highest quality products and services, we use information from our interactions with you and other customers, as well as from other parties. Because we respect your privacy, we have implemented procedures to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe, secure, and responsible manner. We have posted this privacy policy in order to explain our information collection practices and the choices you have about the way information is collected and used.</p>

        <p>As we continue to develop the Luma website and take advantage of advances in technology to improve the services we offer, this privacy policy likely will change. We therefore encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy.</p>

However, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable information at various times and places on this website. In some cases, if you choose not to provide us with the requested information, you may not be able to access all parts of this website or participate in all of its features, pricing, and product selection.</p>

        <p>We receive and store any personally identifiable information you enter on the website, whenever you shop with Luma—online, through our catalogs, or in our stores, or information you give us in any other way, such as by subscribing to our catalogs, email, or mobile messaging.

            <li>To complete your purchase transactions</li>

        </ul>

        <h2 id=""privacy-policy-title-5"">Others With Whom We Share Your Information.</h2>
        <p><b>The Luma Group:</b> All of the above information that we collect, as described  above, may be shared among all Luma entities, including Luma Venia and Luma  Terra stores, website and Private Sales.</p>

        <p><b>Service Providers:</b> We also may disclose information to outside companies that  help us bring you the products and services we offer. For example, we may work  with an outside company to: (a) manage a database of customer information; (b)  assist us in distributing emails; (c) assist us with direct marketing and data  collection; (d) provide us storage and analysis; (d) provide fraud prevention; and  (e) provide other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential. We require that these outside companies agree to keep confidential all information we share with them and to use the information only to perform their obligations in our agreements with them.</p>

        <p><b>Other Companies:</b> We may provide information to carefully selected outside companies when we believe their products or services may be of interest to you.</p>

        <p><b>Business Transitions:</b> We may transfer or share a copy of personal information about you in the event that Luma or one of its properties, affiliates, or subsidiaries goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our website prior to a change of ownership or control of your personal information, if your personal information will be used contrary to this policy. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Luma to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever.</p>

        <p>Luma specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally identifiable information collected from its websites to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information.</p>

        <p><b>Compliance with Law:</b> We may provide access to information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website, to limit our legal liability, and to protect our rights or to protect the rights, property, or safety of visitors of this website or the public.</p>

        <p>Luma partners with advertising companies to place our advertising on publisher websites on the Internet. These advertising companies collect anonymous information about your visits to our web site. This technology involves the use of third party cookies that allow them to develop personalized advertising so that it directly relates to offers that may be of interest to you. You may choose to opt-out of this service we have with our third-party advertising partner. We may also use Luma cookies to provide similar enhanced online marketing to you based on your interests and preferences. You may also choose to opt out of these enhanced online marketing ads.</p>

        <h2 id=""privacy-policy-title-6"">Your Choices Regarding Use Of The Information We Collect</h2>

        <p>You have several choices regarding our handling of your nonpublic personally identifiable information.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Direct Mail or Telephone Marketing:</b> If you shop at the Luma or Private Sales stores and wish to be removed from the list of customers that receive direct mail or telemarketing calls, please either write to Luma Customer Care at 112 West  34th Street, 18th Flr. New York, NY 10120 or call +1 800-403-8838. If you choose to write to us, please include your name, address, and credit card account number (if you have one), and state one of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>""NO MAIL OFFERS"" (if you don't want to receive offers by mail);</li>
                <li>""NO PHONE OFFERS"" (if you don't want to receive offers by phone);</li>
                <li>""NO PHONE OR MAIL OFFERS"" (if you don't want to receive either).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Because customer lists often are prepared well in advance of an offering  (sometimes a few months before the offer is made), you may continue to receive  some offers after you send us a request not to use your information for specified  marketing purposes. We appreciate your patience and understanding in giving us  time to carry out your request.</p>

        <h2 id=""privacy-policy-title-7"">Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are  entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal customer  information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third  parties or corporate affiliates' direct marketing purposes. That notice will identify  the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties and  affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names and addresses. If you  are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a  written request to the following address: Luma Customer Care, 112 West 34th  Street, 18th Floor, New York, NY 10120. Please allow 30 days for a response.</p>

        <h2 id=""privacy-policy-title-8"">Cookies, Web Beacons, and How We Use Them</h2>
        <p>A ""cookie"" is a small data file stored by your Web browser on your computer or  mobile device [hard drive]. It allows us to recognize your computer (but not  specifically who is using it) upon entering our site by associating the identification  numbers in the cookie with other customer information you have provided us.  That customer information is stored on our secured database. A ""web beacon"" or  ""pixel tag"" or ""clear gif"" is typically a one-pixel image, used to pass information  from your computer or mobile device to a website.</p>

        <p>We use cookies and web beacons to keep track of what you have in your  shopping cart and to remember you when you return to the website as well as to  identify the pages you click on during your visit to our site and the name of the  website you visited immediately before clicking to the Luma website. We use this  information to improve our site design, product assortments, customer service,  and special promotions. You can, of course, disable cookies and web beacons  on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your  browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our website will not operate  correctly if you disable cookies. We may also use web beacons, and other  technologies, to help track whether our communications are reaching you, to  measure their effectiveness, or to collect certain non-personal information about  your computer, device, or browser in order to allow us to better design future  communications to you.</p>

        <p>We may contract with third parties who may use cookies and web beacons and collect information on our behalf or provide services such as credit card processing, shipping, promotional services, or data management. We call them our Customer Care Partners. These third parties are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our other Customer Care Partners.</p>


        <h2 id=""privacy-policy-title-9"">Online Account Registration</h2>
        <p>To make online shopping faster and easier, you may register on the Luma website. As a registered customer, you only have to enter your shipping addresses and billing information once; they will be securely stored with us for your future use. Using your name and a password of your choice, you may access your account online at any time to add, delete, or change information. If you are using a public computer, we strongly encourage you to Sign Out when you finish shopping. Your information will still be stored with us but it will not be accessible to anyone else from that computer.</p>

        <h2 id=""privacy-policy-title-10"">Emails</h2>
        <p>You will receive promotional emails from us only if you have asked to receive them. If you do not want to receive email from Luma or its affiliates you can click on the ""Unsubscribe"" link at the bottom of any email communication sent by us. Please allow us 3 business days from when the request was received to complete the removal, as some of our promotions may already have been in process before you submitted your request.</p>

        <h2 id=""privacy-policy-title-11"">Acceptance</h2>
        <p>By using this website, you accept the policies set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
